# Datapad Landing Page Strategy Document

## The Story: From Data Chaos to AI-Powered Growth

Every business today drowns in data but starves for insights. Marketing teams burn budgets on campaigns that don't convert. Sales teams miss obvious opportunities in their pipeline. E-commerce stores lose money on products they think are profitable. Agencies scramble to prove ROI to demanding clients.

**The problem isn't lack of data. It's the gap between having data and knowing what to do with it.**

### Never Include

- Generic benefits like "save time" or "improve efficiency"
- Technical features without business context
- Vague promises without data backing
- Complex setup or implementation details
